<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In the world of software development, API keys and other sensitive credentials are the keys to accessing critical services and applications. Unfortunately, these keys are sometimes accidentally exposed in public repositories, putting both developers and organizations at risk. If left unprotected, malicious actors can exploit these exposed credentials to access and misuse valuable data, leading to breaches, financial losses, and damaged reputations.

**SaveEnv** was created to address this growing problem by automating the process of detecting and notifying developers about exposed OpenAI API keys in ```.env``` files. By continuously monitoring public GitHub repositories, SaveEnv helps prevent sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands. The project's aim is to provide an easy-to-use tool that alerts developers to their mistakes before they can be exploited.

The script automatically scans GitHub every hour for ```.env``` files that may have OpenAI API keys. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

1. The script searches for public repositories with .env files that may contain sensitive data.
2. It identifies OpenAI API keys within these .env files.
3. For each extracted key, the script calls the OpenAI API to verify whether the key is still valid.
4. If the key is valid, the script automatically opens an issue on the affected repository, notifying the developer about the exposed key.


### ðŸ›‘ Disclaimer ðŸ›‘
This tool is designed to help developers protect their sensitive data. It is not intended for malicious use. By using this script, you agree to use it responsibly and within ethical boundaries. Always respect data privacy and security best practices.
