<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**No Phishing** is an advanced browser extension using artificial intelligence to detect phishing threats with 91% accuracy in real time and provides instant notifications about potential phishing threats. It's very easy to install and operate, providing a seamless browsing experience. It's designed for Google Chrome to enhance online security for both individuals and businesses.

### Disclaimer
This extension is intended as a supplementary tool for online safety. While it demonstrates high accuracy, it is not infallible. As the developer, I am not a certified cybersecurity professional, and the extension could make errors. Users are advised to exercise caution and judgment. By using "No Phishing," you acknowledge and accept responsibility for your online safety.
